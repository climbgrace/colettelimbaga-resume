        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Psychology and understanding the way we think has always been an interest of mine. The human brain is complicated and not all brains are the same. Some are born with disorders and other develop as we age. It is unfortunate but that is what therapy is for. Therapy is healthy for every human being and should be taken advantage of if offered. Personally I go to therapy and it has benefited me in so many ways and that really peaked my interest in psychology because I experienced the change and benefit of psychology.The definition of psychology is the study of the human mind and how it functions. I find myself using psychology skills I have learned in every day life when dealing with different type of humans. You have to adapt to each person and I find myself always trying to get into their head and find a next move. One of my best qualities is trying to understand why people do the things they do which has shaped my idea of what I want my future to look like. I want to help others achieve and help them understand themselves better, I want to help people get better and reach their inner full potential. 
<br><br>

        Therapy was the first thing that came to mind but I wanted to do more, that is when I found studies about psychiatry. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor that can prescribe safe drugs to their patients. This is what I plan to become because I would be helping mentally and getting them the prescriptions a patient needs. I have always wanted to make a change in the world, in a positive way, and I genuinely believe this is the way to do it. To help others who don’t understand what or why they are feeling. Helping others and making them healthy will cause a chain reaction in the world. Medicine will be doing the physical benefit while therapy is for their mental state. A psychiatrist does both to benefit their mental and physical state. If drugs are done in a safe productive way, they can be super beneficial for the body. Nowadays there is a drug to cure any form of disability. Psychiatrists go through many schooling and can be trusted and people who have issues should seek for one that is a best fit for them. <br><br>

        To become a psychiatrist there is many steps and I am willing to do what it takes so I can make a difference in the world. If anybody can do it, it is me. I enjoy chemistry and the process of how drugs are made. It is fascinating to know that I would be making a difference with a small pill. I would hope that others see the good in psychology. I am very determined in everything that I do and this is something of importance to me and that I value. I value others lives and will do anything I can to help them make inner peace with themselves.
